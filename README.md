I started writing a project. At first I couldn't figure out where to start, but I decided to start with encrypt.
At first it was difficult to implement encrypt, so I asked Chat-Jipty for help to explain.
He always gave examples, although I didn't immediately want to copy, but from the explanations I understood a little how to write.
At first it didn't work out, but Chat-Jipty suggested where I was making mistakes, and after 4 hours I was still able to write.
I still used the code he gave me a little, but I don't think it's copying üòÅ.
When I wrote encryptor, I started writing file reading and verification. It was easier, but I ran into difficulties with how to create a file.
Creating a file was not difficult for me, but I couldn't figure out how to add a name to the previous file. There were difficulties, but I still managed to do it.
Then I started thinking about what other functions could be added, and asked our colleagues what else could be implemented.
He replied that a decryptor could be made, and I started reading what it was. It turned out that it was a decryption, which turned out to be quite simple.
I took my ready-made code and, with the help of mathematics, added a couple of functions that I could easily paraphrase.
The decryptor came out quickly. Then I started thinking about how to make a language definition, and asked the chat-jipt for ideas. He gave one idea, which I implemented, changing it at my discretion.
The idea was perfect, but I made it easier - it determined the language in the text.
After that, I started writing brute force. I wanted to do this myself, but there were difficulties, so I started watching useful videos and asking my colleague how he implemented it.
I decided to take the idea from the video in words. I liked this process more, and it seemed more feasible.
I implemented everything, but I had to connect everything and push it into the code. During the code review, everything "floated", and I had to rebuild it to make everything work.
I slowly started implementing the client so that I could use the console or jar. It was quite simple, so I implemented it quickly.
This is probably the end of it, because there probably shouldn't be such a long README, but it will be better from now on.
This is my first project in 16 years, so I think you will like the implementation. I tried to make everything very readable and easy.
In 3 months I am very pleased with how much I have grown in my own eyes and how much I already have the ability to write code.

JDK22 is used.
